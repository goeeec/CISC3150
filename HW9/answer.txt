The program crashes because the intance variable - product is not locked.
The method notifyAll() and wait() should have the object locked in order 
to be used. When the notifyAll() method is called, all the threads on wait 
are waken up, and once any of them want to access product, it crashed 
because product is possible to be modified at the same time, which causes
data corruption. To fix this problem, synchronized block should be used to
wrap around the statements to modify product and call notifyAll method.
This way, only one thread at a time can have access to modify product.
